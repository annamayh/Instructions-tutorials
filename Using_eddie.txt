### USING EDDIE ###

login using PuTTy to: eddie.ecdf.ed.ac.uk and type password and username 
NAVIGATING THROUGH EDDIE 
- cd <folder> : changes the folder 
- cd .. : back a folder
- ls : lists all files in the directory 
- pwd : print working directory 
- qsub : submit shell file to job list
- qstat : stats of current jobs (r = running, eqw = error queue waiting, qw = queue waiting)
- qdel : delete job 

(See other file for example shell script, remember to convert to linux file type before sumitting)

login to WinSCP in the same way - use this to move files between the computer and eddie folder 


##Interactive sessions## - for when need to run e.g. R interactivly 

- To start simple interactive session : $qlogin 
- Starting with specifying amount of memory or time longer than 48 hrs: 
	$qlogin -pe interactivemem <NUMBER OF CORES> -l h_vmem=<MEMORY PER CORE>
	$qlogin -l h_rt=HH:MM:SS
- Reconnecting to interactive session: once logged into eddie type: 'screen' and make note of login node, then can qlogin
When logging back into eddie login to specific node e.g. ssh login04-ext.ecdf.ed.ac.uk (for login04)
<$screen -ls>
output: There is a screen on: 133133.pts-190.login04 (Detached)>
For the above example this would be:
<$ screen -r 133133.pts-190.login04>

# loading R# can type directly into interactive session or just type module load in shell script 
$module load R
$R 
#installing and loading packages# done in the same way as in normal R but will need to install package interactivly either in qlogin or in command line i.e. not through the shell script
